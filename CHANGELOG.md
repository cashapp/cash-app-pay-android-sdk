# 2.6.0
## Breaking Changes
- Introduces new button styles and deprecates existing styles. This is also replaces 
`FollowThemeButtonStyle` with two new options: `FollowThemeButtonStyle.Polychrome` and 
`FollowThemeButtonStyle.Monochrome`. To obtain different variants, 
developers should use the XML `style` attribute to specify the variant they want, as follows:

Polychrome Light Variant:
```xml
<app.cash.paykit.core.ui.CashAppPayButton
      style="@style/CAPButtonStyle.Alt"
      android:layout_height="54dp"
      android:layout_width="match_parent"/>
```

Polychrome Dark Variant:
```xml
<app.cash.paykit.core.ui.CashAppPayButton
      style="@style/CAPButtonStyle.Default"
      android:layout_height="54dp"
      android:layout_width="match_parent"/>
```

Monochrome Light Variant:
```xml
<app.cash.paykit.core.ui.CashAppPayButton
      style="@style/CAPButtonStyle.MonochromeLight"
      android:layout_height="54dp"
      android:layout_width="match_parent"/>
```

Monochrome Dark Variant:
```xml
<app.cash.paykit.core.ui.CashAppPayButton
      style="@style/CAPButtonStyle.MonochromeDark"
      android:layout_height="54dp"
      android:layout_width="match_parent"/>
```

# 2.5.0

 - Fix correct usage of `account_reference_id` in `OnFileAction`
 - Add `reference_id` as a parameter of creating a customer request. This is to bring the Android SDK to parity with iOS and Web.

# 2.4.0

 - Fix: `OnFileAction` param `accountReferenceId` is now properly being sent over the network
 - Update Android target SDK version to API 33
 - Update internal dependencies to recent versions, ensuring strong backward compatibility support

# 2.3.0

 - The class `CashAppPayInitializer` was made open, so that androidx.startup can be manually overridden.
 - This version bundles fixes for minify enabled builds.
 - Update internal dependency on `OkHttp` to version `4.11.0`.
 
## Breaking Changes
 
 - Renamed class `CashAppCashAppPayApiNetworkException` to `CashAppPayApiNetworkException`
 - This version contains a change to the bundled Cash App Pay button.
Previously, `light` and `dark` variants of the button were made possible by using 2 different
views, respectively `CashAppPayButtonLight` an `CashAppPayButtonDark`. As of this version, the
there will only be a single `CashAppPayButton` view, which has been updated to support both variants.
To obtain different variants, developers should use the XML `style` attribute to specify the variant they want, as follows:


Light Variant:
```xml
<app.cash.paykit.core.ui.CashAppPayButton
      style="@style/CAPButtonStyle.Light"
      android:layout_height="54dp"
      android:layout_width="match_parent"/>
```

Dark Variant:
```xml
<app.cash.paykit.core.ui.CashAppPayButton
      style="@style/CAPButtonStyle.Dark"
      android:layout_height="54dp"
      android:layout_width="match_parent"/>
```

This change makes it possible for developer to use the button in a more flexible way, such as using
a style that changes accordingly to the OS theme.

You should migrate any instances of `CashAppPayButtonLight` and `CashAppPayButtonDark` to `CashAppPayButton`.

# 2.2.1

Here's what has changed on this release:

 - Information that can be considered PII is now marked as such by implementing the interface `PiiContent`.
   - This is possibly a breaking change, but in practice for the majority of people out there, these shouldn't be properties that you're using.
  - Improved Thread management to prevent memory leaks and unexpected behavior.


# 2.2.0

In this release of our open source SDK, we've made a significant update that involves modifying the date types within our returned payloads from string to Instant. Please note that this modification is a breaking change. Here's what has been altered:

 - The dates in the models have been transitioned from `string` to `Instant`.
 - Metrics timestamps are now accurately recorded in `Epoch usec`.
 - In situations where the auth flow token has expired, it will now be automatically refreshed, thereby ensuring a successful request.
 - We've added a new state: `Refreshing`. This state is triggered exclusively when the auth flow token needs a refresh during a customer authorization attempt. Typically, this state acts as a bridge between `Authorizing` and `PollingTransactionStatus` states.


# 2.1.0

This version introduces a concrete type for `GrantType` under the `Grant` class. Before this field was a `string`. 
This is a breaking change. The following has changed:

- `Grant.type` from `string` to `GrantType` <br/>
- Possible `GrantType` values: `ONE_TIME`, `EXTENDED`, `UNKNOWN`. These values match their spelling with what is described by our public API.
- For convenience, `ONE_TIME` applies to a grant can only be used once, where `EXTENDED` applies to grants that can be repeatedly used.
- `CashAppPayPaymentAction` no longer contains the `redirectUri` parameter. Instead, pass that value to the `createCustomerRequest` function.
- Fixes to the behavior of `startWithExistingCustomerRequest`


# 2.0.0

This version introduces support for multiple `CashAppPayPaymentAction` per `createCustomerRequest`.
This is a breaking change. The following functions have changed:

 - `createCustomerRequest(paymentAction: CashAppPayPaymentAction)` to `createCustomerRequest(paymentAction: CashAppPayPaymentAction, redirectUri: String?)` <br/>
 - `CashAppPayPaymentAction` no longer contains the `redirectUri` parameter. Instead pass that value to the `createCustomerRequest` function.

And the following functions were introduced:

 - `createCustomerRequest(paymentActions: List<CashAppPayPaymentAction>, redirectUri: String?)`
 - `updateCustomerRequest(requestId: String, paymentActions: List<CashAppPayPaymentAction>)`

# 1.0.8

 - Added the property `environment` to internal analytics.

# 1.0.7

 - Breaking change: `authorizeCustomerRequest` no longer requires a `context` to be passed as a parameter.
 - Breaking change: Several class names have changed to be consistent across platforms. Which means that we have changed `PayKit` to `CashAppPay`.

   Classes that are renamed are:

   `PayKitState` to `CashAppPayState` <br/>
   `PayKitExceptionState` to `CashAppPayExceptionState` <br/>
   `PayKitCurrency` to `CashAppPayCurrency` <br/>
   `PayKitPaymentAction` to `CashAppPayPaymentAction` <br/>
   `CashAppPayKit` to `CashAppPay` <br/>
   `CashAppPayKitFactory` to `CashAppPayFactory` <br/>
   `CashAppPayKitListener` to `CashAppPayListener` <br/>
   `CashPayKitLightButton` to `CashAppPayLightButton` <br/>
   `CashPayKitDarkButton` to `CashAppPayDarkButton` <br/>
